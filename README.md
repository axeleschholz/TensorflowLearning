# TensorflowLearning
This repo documents my journey with Tensorflow, from working with tutorials to building and refining my own models using the keras API. I'm not where I would like to be, but the journey has just begun.

## Tutorial
This directory is just the instance of an online tutorial on building a keras model around a mnist dataset. I used this model to practice saving and loading pretrained models, guided by a different tutorial.

## AdditionModel
This was my first foray into developing a model from scratch to solve a novel problem. In order to simplify data gathering and work within the limits of my machine I chose a simple task: adding or subtracting two numbers. Below is the process I went through building and refining the model:
